            Web development is a very broad topic as there are many ways to
            build a website and each website varies in complexity.

            In this class, we'll learn a bit about how the web works and how
            to build a website!
            We'll learn how to build a website by creating two websites. The
            first website is a fun site that will help us learn HTML and CSS.
            The second website will be a more personal website, one that you can
            share with friends and continue to update after this class.

            In 1957, Russia launches the very first satellite into space.
            This set off the "race for space" as Americans realized that while
            we had been focused on building biggers cars and TVs, other
            countries were exploring opportunities in space.

          <aside class="notes">
            Not wanting to be left behind, the U.S. government created a
            division called ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency). This
            agency focused on creating space-age technologies like rockets,
            weapons and computers.

            In the 1960s - ARPA began creating a network of computers that could
            talk to each other, known as ARPAnet.

            In 1960 - ARPAnet sent it's very first message, "LOGIN". This was
            the beginnings of what we now call the Internet.

            In 1991 - Tim Berners-Lee, a computer programmer in Switzerland,
            had the idea "computers are now able to send information, but what
            if they could also request information?" With this idea, Tim
            published the first website.

            and a browser to show us the webpage.

            There are several browsers we can choose from, the more popular ones
            are Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

                - Envelope
                - Paper that says "html"
                - Paper that says "css"

            Steps:
              - Browser passes paper to ISP
              - ISP passes paper to DNS
              - DNS adds the IP Address
              - DNS passes back to ISP
              - ISP passes off to the router
              - Router sends paper to Google server
              - Google server creates an envelope with To and From address
              - Google server adds HTML and CSS files to envelope
              - Google server passes envelope to router
              - Router sends envelope to ISP
              - ISP passes the envelope to the browser
              - Browser renders the html and css files

            When I enter an website's address in the browser's address bar and
            press enter, my computer is going to send a request to the computer's
            Internet Service Provider.

            My request includes three pieces of information, my IP address, the name
            of the website I'm requesting and any additional information about
            my request.

            The Internet Service Provider is going to look at the website name
            and using something called DNS to translate the website name to an
            IP address. Just like my computer has an IP address, all other
            computers have an IP address. The reason we type in a website's name
            instead of an IP address is because they're very hard to remember.

            For example, I can go to Gooogle by typing in their IP address
            (demo: ping google.com and copy IP address).

            This is similar to how we store someone's name when adding them to
            our contacts. We don't want to rememeber their phone number because
            it's easier for us to remember their name.

            So the Internet Service Provider knows the website's name but the
            internet communicates with IP Addresses, not by website names. So
            before the ISP can send the request, they need to know the website's
            IP Address.

            To do this, the ISP can ask the DNS system for help. The DNS system
            will look up the website name and find the IP address.


            The Internet Service Provider will then use their access to the
            internet to pass on the request.

            The Internet will use information that's in the request to identify
            where the information lives and return a response.

            That response will include two files, an html file and a CSS file.

            Internet connections are established by delivering electronic
            pulses, lightwaves in fiber optic cables and radiowaves.

            The HTML file contains all the content for our site.
            The CSS file is used to make our website beautiful.
            CSS is how we add color to our page and place each picture or link
            in a specific place.

            We will talk about CSS later on in class. First, let's talk about
            HTML.

          <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
          <p>HTML stands for: <span class="bold">Hypertext Markup Language</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Hypertext</span> - refers to links on a webpage</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Markup</span> - informs the browser how to present text</p>
          <p><span class="bold">Language</span> - set of rules so others can understand</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            HTML is called a "markup" language because we use it to inform the
            browser of how to treat text differently.

          <aside class="notes">
            Similar to how a teacher markups a student's report to give
            information to the student, we want to "markup" our text so the

          <aside class="notes">
            We write HTML by using something called "tags". To "markup" our
            content with HTML, we create an opening tag, add our content, and
            then add a closing tag.

            You can think of HTML tags as bookends. You need both bookends to
            tell the browser where to start and where to end.

            Once we have an opening tag with content and a closing tag, we've
            created what's called an HTML element.

            To write HTML, we'll want to open an application called Atom. Atom
            is a text editor that helps us write HTML and CSS. Each of you have
            Atom installed but we'll come around and help everyone get started.

            Once you have Atom open, let's create a file.
            File -> New File -> Save As -> index.html

            Why the name index?
            It's a common practice for the homepage to be saved as the index
            page. The concept probably came from the idea that the index page
            or the website's homepage, acts as a reference to all the other pages
            a user can visit.

            So to start our website, let's add this information to our page.
            When adding this to your page, you may notice that I have certain
            tags indented. This indentation is for us. The browser doesn't care
            if everything is squished together and written on one line but it
            makes it very difficult for us to read. The indentation also helps
            us identify mistakes.
